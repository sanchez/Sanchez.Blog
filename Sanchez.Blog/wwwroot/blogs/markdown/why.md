# Opening with Markdown
For a long time I have wanted to make a blog engine and provide a platform for me to log my achievements and hard-falls. After looking around I quickly discovered the limited options for Markdown Parsing in a DotNet space, and even more so that I wanted to extend my knowledge with Blazor (and the limited options of being able to create a Blazor driven Markdown Renderer). There began my Markdown journey...

## Why F#
After writing some basic proof of concepts in C# I quickly began to fall in love with F# and everything it had to offer, and so I thought to myself "What better way to learn F# than to make a Markdown Parser?" Here we are, this site is currently being delievered with an implementation of that exact idea

# What is the future
I want to make a strong community presence with these blogs and the libraries that are built and discussed here. The Markdown Parser being one of the cores and with that I plan to continuously add new features and improve the performance, all while squashing all the bugs. I have begun to lay out some release schedules on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanchez/Sanchez.Markdown) which users are more than welcome to contribute and provide feedback.

To me, this library is just a small stepping stone into the features and delievers I would like to start pushing out into a community that is ever growing and evolving!
