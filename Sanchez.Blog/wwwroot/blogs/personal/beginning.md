# Welcome
I would like to start by just welcoming you to my playground which I hope to be further developing and expanding in the foreseeable (I hope that is spelt right) future! Thank you very much for taking your time to stumble across this and for looking through and giving feedback within this site.

## What to expect?
You can expect to see different bits of my learning through beginning my journey in the industry of Software Development and with that see the progress of my skills and the projects I produce develop and shape with time.

### The focus and drive?
I have a strong fascination for reinventing the wheel and extending it from being round to being round with bells and whistles. There begins my drive to create a Markdown Parser built and maintained on the dotnet stack, and the best way to test my parser is to make a blog and showcase the power and beauty behind it!

## What do I do?
I program. It's my hobby, it's my job, it's my dreams
