I have recently come to the realization of **The Broken Repair Cycle**, a moment in my life where I think about all the times something has broken and I invest my time and money into fixing it.

# What is it?
"The Broken Repair Cycle" is the process where once you start to repair or improve an object to extend it's life and keep the item functioning. However once you start modifying the object you cannot stop with the modifications. 

I think way back to my university laptop; one time the keyboards ribbon cable came out, so I opened the laptop and put the cable back in. A pretty basic procedure and everything worked as expected, and yet the cable continued to fall out a couple of other times later on. Which I guess is to be expected, it fell out once so it is highly likely to happen again and again, but then the bluetooth failed. Now it could just have been the end of the life for the laptop and age had caught up, but the laptop was well taken care of and I wasn't the only one with similar issues. Finally it crossed the line where if I tilted the screen, there was the chance that the hinge would short the wifi card and crash my laptop...

## The improve cycle
It's also possible to get stuck in **The Broken Repair Cycle** if you start doing modifications and *improving* an object. Once you start improving you will constantly get ideas on how it could be better improved and want to make lots of adjustments. But at the same time the object begins to break and so you need to fix the existing issues while adding new features!

# How do I break out of it?
Simply put, **You Can't!** And if you think you have broken cycle then chances are you just haven't the bigger issue or you are supressing your inner drive to stay in the cycle.

> The only true way to break free is to just accept the flaws and not use the object anymore
